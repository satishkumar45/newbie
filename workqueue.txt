workqueue use kernel thread to handle the deferred work.
this bottom half runs in process context.

workqueues can be scheduled and sleep.

if your work needs to sleep then only way left is to defer the work by 
using workqueues.

but if your work need not to sleep then better to go for tasklets/softirq.
