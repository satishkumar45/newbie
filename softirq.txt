softirq:

softirqs are a set of statically defined bottom halves which can run simultaneously on any of the processor.
even two of the same type can run on any processor concurrently 
because two softirqs can run concurrently,it is the responsibility of the programmer to take care of synchronization between softirqs

A softirq never preempts other softirq.
only interrupt handler can preempt softirq.

softirq runs with interrupt enabled and can't sleep as it runs in
interrupt context.
