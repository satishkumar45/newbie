Tasklets is another bottom-half mechanism which is built on top of softirq.

same tasklets cannot run on morethan one processor at same time.

so in tasklets we need not to worry about synchronization among them.

Tasklets has very simple interface as compared to softirq.

tasklets cannot sleep as it runs in interrupt context.
